# HeyGubamint

So...

This was my Backend Capstone at [Nashville Software School](http://www.nashvillesoftwareschool.com). I'm not proud of it, but it happened. I take that back. I *am* proud of it, I just wish it was different.

I was part of [evening cohort 2](http://nss-cohort-e2.github.io/) at NSS. We spent a year, three times a week, learning all about the fundementals of web development and C#. 

And then demo day happened.

HeyGubamint is a working webAPI project. In the Evening cohort, we never covered web API. I don't know why, but we didn't. I didn't want to do an MVC project - MVC seems very 2004 - so I taught myself Web API.

And it worked.

My frontend, however, didn't. I wrote it in [riot.js](http://www.riotjs.com) to prove that I could learn something that wasn't taught, and it broke. It broke hard. It worked fine on the macOS side of my laptop, but when I ported it to visual studio, everything went up in flames. I spent three hours trying to fix it until 4 AM the morning before presentations. No luck. I threw together the worlds worst Angular partial so I could prove my Web API worked, and I presented. People took my resume, mostly out of pity.

HeyGubamint is a monument to my failure. However, I want to come back to it and make it a success.

Unfortunately, I don't think that will be in c#.NET. At least not right now. My virtual machine is eating away at my mac, and I need to... avail myself of windows for a minute. I've always been interested in mobile development, and a 70gig VMWare file is preventing me from downloading XCode (or even Xamarin studio!) on my mac. I'll look at mac friendly .NET core that was released today, but right now, Windows needs to go so I can use this computer in front of me.

I'm leaving this for the commits. I did good work here, teaching myself a lot, and this is a testament and story about what happens when development goes wrong. And hopefully, it's not the end of the world.
